# DL-Processor

**DLD Project Inquiry ⇄ Salesforce Reconciler** — Sobha Realty · Registration / DLD team.

Each month Registrations exports a DLD "Project Inquiry" report per project and needs to find where Salesforce is out-of-date: resales the DLD caught but SF didn't, price amendments, unbooked units, mortgages logged as buyers, etc. DL-Processor imports the DLD files, imports Salesforce, matches them at the unit level and produces per-project HTML dashboards and audit-task CSVs.

Lives inside the P-Charter repo as a git subtree: `Desktop\p-charter\dl-processor\`.

## What it does

There are **only two data sources** — DLD GOV (Dubai Land Department) and Salesforce. Compare answers one question per unit: *is this in DLD? is this in SF? do they agree?* Optionally a third reference — staff-maintained SQM area per unit — adds an area cross-check signal.

### Naming gotcha

The SF export is called `DLD -ALL-<timestamp>.xlsx` because the **Salesforce report is named "DLD -ALL"** (it tracks DLD-related fields — buyer, DLD amount, pre-reg status). Don't confuse it with actual DLD GOV files.

| File looks like                                      | Source     | Goes into  |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|
| `DLD -ALL-2026-04-22-15-11-56.xlsx`                  | Salesforce | `sf-input/` |
| `ProjectInquiryReport.xps` / `.csv`                  | DLD GOV    | `input/`   |
| `Sobha Central II.csv`, `Sobha Solis.csv`, `SKYSCAPE.csv` | DLD GOV    | `input/`   |

Each compare row is categorized as one of:

| Status         | Meaning                                                          |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `MATCH`        | DLD and SF agree on unit, buyer, and price (within tolerance)    |
| `PRICE_UP`     | DLD price is higher than SF — resale at higher price, not reflected |
| `PRICE_DOWN`   | DLD price is lower than SF — price amendment not posted          |
| `BUYER_MISMATCH` | DLD last buyer name differs from SF applicant (after multi-applicant + transliteration check) |
| `AREA_MISMATCH` | DLD `net_area` vs staff-recorded SQM differ by ≥ project threshold (default 5%) |
| `DLD_ONLY`     | DLD has the unit, SF has no booking                              |
| `SF_ONLY`      | SF booked, DLD has no record                                     |

## Install & launch

**Requirements:** Windows (tested on Sobha workstations — no admin needed), Node.js ≥ 18.

### First run

```bat
cd C:\Users\<you>\Desktop\p-charter\dl-processor
npm install
dl-processor.bat
```

The `.bat` launcher auto-discovers Node, auto-installs dependencies on first run, sets UTF-8 (`chcp 65001`), and opens the menu.

### From P-Charter

Launch `p-charter.bat` → menu option `[D] DLD Audit` — runs inline (same window since v9.3.x).

### Desktop app (v1.1)

For staff users, the Windows desktop build is the recommended surface — see `BUILDING.md` for how to produce the installer. The sidebar is always full-width (icon + text — the v1.0 collapse button has been removed); a single project selector in the top bar filters every page and includes Salesforce-only projects in addition to DLD-imported ones. Schema migrations run automatically at every app launch; on a v1.0→v1.1 upgrade the renderer briefly shows an *"Upgrading database…"* splash if the migration takes more than ~2 seconds.

### Non-interactive

```bat
node index.js <subcommand> [args]
```

See [CLI subcommands](#cli-subcommands).

## Quick start — the monthly flow

1. **Drop DLD files** into `dl-processor\input\` — any mix of `.xps` or `.csv` per-project files, or the combined `ProjectInquiryReport`.
2. **Drop the SF xlsx** into `dl-processor\sf-input\` — the `DLD -ALL-<timestamp>.xlsx` export.
3. Launch `dl-processor.bat`. From the menu pick:
   - `[6] FULL PIPELINE` — processes everything in `input/` and `sf-input/`, or
   - `[7] QUICK AUDIT` — pick specific files, run the full pipeline on just those.
4. **(Optional)** Top up area data when you have new SQM measurements:
   - `[Y] Area template` → `[1] Generate template` → fills `output/Changes Template/area-template-<project>.csv`.
   - Open in Excel, fill the `area_sqm` column for the units you have data on, save into `input/Changes Template Input/`.
   - `[Y] Area template` → `[2] Apply filled template` → upserts into `master_data.area_sqm`.
   - Re-run `[3] Compare` to see new A11 / AREA_MISMATCH signals.
5. **Review DLD-proposed changes (inline, v1.1).** In the desktop app, click `5. Review pending` in the sidebar. The Review Pending page opens with two tabs:
   - **Needs review** — per-row `✓ Approve` / `✗ Reject`; the `New (edit)` cell lets you override the proposed value before approving. BUYER_MISMATCH rows expose `🔗 Teach alias` so the same false-positive doesn't recur next month.
   - **Drift log** — read-only list of values silently overwritten at compare time when a fresh DLD or SF snapshot disagrees with the previous one.

   Every action writes the change directly to `master_data` and appends to `audit_log` — no more CSV roundtrip. See [Reviewing changes (v1.1)](#reviewing-changes-v11) below.
6. When done:
   - `[O]` opens `output/dashboard.html` (cross-project summary).
   - `[R]` reveals the `output/` folder in Explorer.
   - Per-project `.compare.html` reports are in `output/compare/`.

Re-running `compare` after any change is cheap — it rebuilds from what's already in SQLite.

## The menu in detail

```
[1]  Parse & Import DLD       pick .xps or .csv file
[2]  Import Salesforce        pick .xlsx file
[3]  Compare (DLD vs SF)      writes compare.csv / .html / audit-tasks
[4]  Month-over-Month Diff    writes diff.csv / .html
[5]  Master Data (staff edits) unit-level buyer overrides
[6]  FULL PIPELINE (folders)  process everything in input/ & sf-input/
[7]  QUICK AUDIT              pick DLD + SF files, run everything

[A]  Audit Report             reconciliation summary + per-project mapping
[P]  Projects list            projects in DB with their mapping
[S]  Status                   DB overview (counts per table)
[O]  Open latest HTML report  opens output/dashboard.html if present
[R]  Reveal output folder

[Y]  Area template            generate / apply staff-filled SQM CSVs
[V]  Review pending changes   v1.1 — prints a hint pointing at the desktop app's inline page
[B]  Apply pending decisions  legacy — reads a CSV with change_id+decision, commits approvals

[L]  Last drop                run full pipeline on the newest DLD + SF files
[Z]  Archive output           snapshot output/ to output/archive/<timestamp>/

[Q]  Quit
```

### `[5] Master Data (staff edits)`

DLD transactions sometimes have a bank (mortgage holder) as the last party when the real buyer sold to someone else. The Master Data submenu lets you pick a project, pick a bank-only unit, and enter the real buyer name. Compare reads from `master_data` instead of the bank.

`master_data` is the single source of truth for staff-curated values. It is seeded from `manual_override` + `manual_area` on first run (those legacy tables are then frozen). Every DLD import queues proposed changes into `pending_change` for staff review before they take effect.

### `[V] Review pending changes`

> **v1.1 — primary workflow is the desktop app.** Click `5. Review pending` in the sidebar to open the inline Review Pending page (two tabs, override/approve/reject/teach-alias per row). See [Reviewing changes (v1.1)](#reviewing-changes-v11).

The terminal `[V]` entry / `node index.js review-pending` CLI no longer produces an HTML+CSV roundtrip — it prints a hint pointing at the desktop app. Kept as a no-op shim for one release cycle.

### `[B] Apply pending decisions`

> **Legacy — deprecated for v1.1, will be removed in v1.2.** Reads a CSV with `change_id` + `decision` columns and commits approved rows to `master_data`. Retained for users who still drive reconciliation through `apply-pending.csv` files. The recommended path is the inline Review Pending page; the CSV roundtrip is no longer used by the desktop app.

### `[Y] Area template`

Drives the staff-maintained SQM data flow. Two sub-options:

- **`[1] Generate template`** — emits `output/Changes Template/area-template-<project>.csv` (or `area-template-all.csv`) with one row per DLD unit, pre-populating any existing `master_data.area_sqm` values. Staff fill the `area_sqm` column and (optionally) the `source_note` column.
- **`[2] Apply filled template`** — reads a filled CSV from `input/Changes Template Input/`; upserts every row whose `area_sqm` is a positive number into `master_data`. Blank rows are skipped silently. Unknown project names skip with a warning. Each apply writes one entry to `logs/audit.jsonl`.

### `[Z] Archive output`

Snapshots the current `output/` tree to `output/archive/<YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM>/`. Use before re-running on a corrected DLD file when you want to keep the previous run's HTML reports and CSVs. The archive folder is preserved across subsequent runs.

### `[L] Last drop`

One-click full pipeline. Scans `input/` for the newest `.xps`/`.csv` and `sf-input/` for the newest `.xlsx`, shows the picked filenames + dates, and runs the full pipeline (parse → import → SF import → compare → diff) after a single confirmation.

### `[A] Audit Report`

Reconciliation report (previously accessible as `[V]` before v0.9.16):

- Rows imported vs rows in the raw xlsx.
- Per-project completeness — missing SF unit / DLD unit / price.
- Projects matched to a DLD row in the DB.
- SF booking cross-check — percentage of audit rows whose booking name exists in the current SF snapshot.
- **Area cross-check coverage** — per-project `master_data.area_sqm` row count vs DLD unit count + total percentage. Lets you see which projects still need staff to fill area templates.

Every run is written to `logs/audit.jsonl`.

## Reviewing changes (v1.1)

> Replaces the legacy `review-pending` → CSV → `apply-pending` two-step.

In the desktop app, click **`5. Review pending`** in the sidebar. The page opens with a project filter on top and two tabs:

### `Needs review` tab

Actionable rows — every `pending_change` whose `decision='pending'`. One row per `(unit, field)`.

| Column        | Behavior                                                                                          |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `☐`           | Multi-select for batch actions                                                                    |
| `Unit + Project` | Clickable — opens the [per-unit history side panel](#viewing-change-history)                   |
| `Field + Type` | E.g. `purchase_price_aed MISMATCH`, `buyer_name BUYER_MISMATCH`                                  |
| `Current`     | Read-only current `master_data` value (with source label `staff` / `dld_approved`)                |
| `New (edit)`  | Editable input prefilled with the proposed value. Type to override before approving.              |
| `Actions`     | `✓ Approve` / `✗ Reject` per row. BUYER_MISMATCH rows additionally show `🔗 Teach alias`.        |

Filter chips above the table: `All` / `MISMATCH` / `BUYER_MISMATCH` / `AREA_MISMATCH` / `PRICE_UP` / `PRICE_DOWN`. Batch actions at the bottom: `[Approve selected (N)]` / `[Reject selected]`.

**Approve** writes the final value (your typed override if you edited the cell, else the proposed value) straight to `master_data`, marks the `pending_change` row `approved`, and appends an `audit_log` row.

**Reject** marks the row `rejected` and leaves `master_data` unchanged. An `audit_log` entry still records the action so the queue is reproducible.

**`🔗 Teach alias`** (BUYER_MISMATCH only) opens a modal: *"Always treat 'AlGhumlasi' = 'Alghumlasi' for project ONE? (or globally)"*. Confirming inserts a `buyer_alias` row and auto-approves every other pending BUYER_MISMATCH with the same normalized name pair on the page — saves the same false-positive from recurring next month.

### `Drift log` tab

Read-only. Lists every `pending_change` whose `decision='auto_applied'` — values silently overwritten at compare time because a fresh DLD or SF snapshot disagreed with the previous one. Columns: `When`, `Unit + Project` (clickable → side panel), `Field`, `Old → New`, `Source` (`DLD import` / `SF import`). Use this to spot price corrections or buyer changes that landed without review.

No CSV roundtrip is involved. The legacy `apply-pending` CLI still works for one release cycle (deprecated in v1.1, removed in v1.2).

---

## Viewing change history

### Global `📜 History` page

New sidebar entry between `Tools` and `Backup`. Shows every change to live data across all projects, newest first.

**Filters** (all combine with AND):

- `Range` — `Today` / `Last 7 days` / `Last 30 days` / `Last 90 days` / `All time` / `Custom…`
- `Project` — populated from the same projects-list query used by the top bar (now includes Salesforce-only projects, see below)
- `Action` — `All` / `approve` / `override` / `reject` / `auto_apply` / `learn_alias`
- `Source` — `All` / `review_pending` / `import_dld` / `import_sf` / `apply_pending`
- `Unit` — free-text exact match on `unit_number`

**Columns** (sortable): `When` (default desc), `Project`, `Unit` (clickable → side panel), `Field`, `Old → New`, `Action + Source`.

**Export CSV** dumps the current filtered set (not just the visible page) to `audit-log-YYYYMMDD-HHmm.csv` via the system save dialog.

### Per-unit history side panel

Click any unit cell — in Review Pending, the History page, the Projects page, or the Status page — to slide in a 400px-wide panel from the right showing that unit's full audit trail:

- **Current state** (live values from `master_data`): `buyer_name`, `purchase_price_aed`, `area_sqm`, `status`, `procedure_number`.
- **History** — every `audit_log` event for that `(project_id, unit_number_norm)`, newest first, grouped by timestamp. Each event shows the field, old → new value, and `action · source` (e.g. `override · review_pending`).
- `[×]` or `Esc` closes the panel; `[View in global History →]` deep-links to the `📜 History` page pre-filtered to that unit.

## Restoring from backup

> v1.1 adds an impact-summary modal before any DB swap.

Click **`Import DB`** in the desktop app and pick a `.zip` backup. The app extracts to a temp directory, reads the embedded `meta.json`, opens the contained `dld-sync.sqlite` read-only, and shows a confirmation modal:

```

```

`[Cancel]` deletes the temp directory and leaves your DB untouched. `[Confirm import]` first writes a `dld-sync.sqlite.bak.{timestamp}` safety copy of the current DB, then moves the imported file into place and restarts the DB connection.

**Old backups without `meta.json`** (anything exported before v1.1) fall back to *"Created: unknown, contents not verified"* — the modal shows only current-DB counts. The import still works after `[Confirm]`; the safety `.bak.{timestamp}` is still written.

### Key DB tables

- **`dld_project`** — one row per DLD project we've ever seen.
- **`dld_snapshot`** — one row per DLD file imported; SHA-256 of the source.
- **`dld_unit`** — properties within a snapshot (unit number, type, `net_area`).
- **`dld_transaction`** — per-unit transactions (Sale, Sell-Pre, Mortgage, etc. with party + date + amount).
- **`sf_snapshot`** — one row per SF xlsx imported.
- **`sf_booking`** — one row per SF booking; includes primary applicant + co-applicants 2–4 + `applicant_details`.
- **`project_mapping`** — overrides for DLD ↔ SF translation, including per-project `area_threshold_pct`.
- **`master_data`** — wide table, one row per `(project_id, unit_number_norm)`. Single source of truth for staff-curated values (`buyer_name`, `purchase_price_aed`, `area_sqm`, etc.). Each field has a `_source` provenance column (`staff` / `dld_approved`) and a `_decided_at` timestamp. Seeded from `manual_override` + `manual_area` on first run.
- **`pending_change`** — tall audit trail. One row per `(unit, field)` proposed change. `decision` starts as `pending` and is set to `approved` / `rejected` (review_pending UI) or `auto_applied` (compare-time drift). v1.1 adds `change_type` (`MISMATCH` / `DLD_DRIFT` / `SF_DRIFT`) and `override_value` (the user-typed final value, when an inline override happened). Approved rows are applied to `master_data` from the inline Review Pending page.
- **`audit_log`** — **(v1.1.)** Append-only event log; one row per change to live data. Records `action` (`approve`/`override`/`reject`/`auto_apply`/`learn_alias`), `source` (`review_pending`/`import_dld`/`import_sf`/`apply_pending`/`compare`), `old_value`/`new_value`, and FK `change_id` into `pending_change`. Indexed by `(project_id, unit_number_norm, ts DESC)` for the per-unit side panel and by `(project_id, ts DESC)` for the global History page.
- **`buyer_alias`** — **(v1.1.)** Learnable equivalence pairs for buyer-name normalization. `(variant, canonical)` are stored already-normalized; `project_id NULL` = global alias. Populated by the `🔗 Teach alias` button on the Review Pending page and seeded with a built-in transliteration map (~50 Sobha-context Arabic-Latin pairs).
- **`schema_migration`** — **(v1.1.)** One row per applied migration (`id`, `name`, `applied_at`). Driven by `src/migrations/`; idempotent — only un-applied migrations execute at each `openDb()` call.
- **`manual_override`** — **(legacy, frozen after migration to `master_data`).** Pre-v0.9.16 per-unit buyer overrides. Still readable; no new writes.
- **`manual_area`** — **(legacy, frozen after migration to `master_data`).** Pre-v0.9.16 staff-recorded SQM. Still readable; no new writes.

## How projects are mapped

DLD names and SF names rarely match exactly. A `Waves` project sheet in DLD maps to `sub_project='Waves'` / `unit_prefix='W'` in SF, so DLD unit `101` becomes SF unit `W-101`.

Three layers, in priority order:

1. **`config/project-mapping.json`** — hand-written overrides (takes precedence).
2. **Auto-inference** — group SF bookings by `sub_project`, detect the dominant unit prefix, match DLD project name by containment.
3. **No mapping** — project falls out of compare. Visible in `[V]` as "unmatched".

`unitTransforms` and `buildingTransforms` rewrite DLD unit numbers before the SF prefix is prepended. See the existing entries in `config/project-mapping.json` for examples.

---

## Multi-applicant name matching

> Added in v0.9.14.

DLD records the buyer name on the latest non-bank purchase transaction. Salesforce records up to **five** name fields per booking:

1. `applicant_name` — primary applicant
2. `applicant_2_name`, `applicant_3_name`, `applicant_4_name` — additional co-applicants
3. `applicant_details` — usually a cleaned primary name (titles stripped) OR a co-owner name when the booking has multiple applicants

Compare walks all five slots and matches the DLD buyer against each one in priority order. The first slot that overlaps wins.

- **Primary slot match → MATCH** (no flag).
- **Non-primary slot match → MATCH + A10 flag** plus `co-applicant:<field>` in the reason column. The match is informative — no action required, but reviewers can filter by `A10` to audit co-applicant matches if they want.
- **No slot matches → BUYER_MISMATCH** (existing path; A8 normalisation, transliteration, etc. still apply).

Net effect on a typical month: a meaningful chunk of rows that used to land in BUYER_MISMATCH because the DLD buyer was a co-owner now correctly classify as MATCH+A10.

---

## Area cross-check (SQM)

> Added in v0.9.14. Area data migrated to `master_data` in v0.9.16.

DLD records `net_area` per unit. The Sobha-recorded saleable / built-up area lives in the `master_data.area_sqm` field (previously `manual_area`, migrated on first run of v0.9.16+), fed by the `[Y] Area template` workflow. Compare emits an area signal when both sides exist.

**Signal rules** (see `computeAreaSignal` in `src/compare.js`):

- |Δ%| < 0.5% → `none` (rounding noise; no signal).
- 0.5% ≤ |Δ%| < threshold → **A11 flag** (soft). Existing match status unchanged. Common cause: common-area allocation, saleable-vs-net rounding.
- |Δ%| ≥ threshold → **AREA_MISMATCH status** (hard) when the row would otherwise be MATCH. If the row already has a higher-precedence problem (BUYER_MISMATCH, PRICE_*, DLD_ONLY, SF_ONLY), the existing status is kept and `A11` is added — fix the primary issue first; the area gap may resolve once the right SF row is matched.

**Threshold resolution** (highest precedence first):

1. `project_mapping.area_threshold_pct` (DB column — manual / future UI override)
2. `config.overrides[<project>].areaThresholdPct`
3. `config.defaults.areaThresholdPct`
4. Hard-coded fallback `5`

Per-project example:

```json
"Sobha Reserve": {
  "sf_sub_project": "Sobha Reserve",
  "sf_unit_prefix": "SR-V",
  "areaThresholdPct": 8
}
```

Status priority for sort and audit-task ordering: `BUYER_MISMATCH (0), AREA_MISMATCH (1), DLD_ONLY (2), SF_ONLY (3), PRICE_DOWN (4), PRICE_UP (5), MATCH (6)`.

The `[V]` reconciliation report includes an "Area cross-check coverage" section — per project, how many DLD units have a `manual_area` row, plus a total percentage. Use it to see which projects still need staff to fill area templates.

---

## HTML reports — what the filters do

The per-project `<name>.compare.html` and `all-projects.compare.html` master:

1. **Stat cards** — MATCH / PRICE ↑ / PRICE ↓ / BUYER / **AREA** / DLD-only / SF-only, each clickable.
   - Click → only that status shows.
   - Click again → all statuses come back.
   - `Ctrl`/`Shift`+click → toggle multiple.
2. **Top search box** — substring filter across every column.
3. **Per-column header filters** — work alongside the search box (AND together).
4. **"Hide unsold" toggle** — hides developer-held units (DLD type "Owner (no transaction)").
5. **Group by** — group rows by status / tx type / unit type / SF status / project (master).
6. **Columns ▾** — hide / show columns.
7. **Reset** — clears all filters.
8. **Export CSV** — current filtered view.
9. **Overrides (N)** — edit the Actual Buyer / Notes columns inline; export and re-import via `apply-overrides`.

Area columns added in v0.9.14: `Manual SQM`, `Area Δ %`, `Area Δ sqm`. Audit flags chip column shows the active A-codes per row.

Buyer columns added in v0.9.15: `DLD #` (count of DLD buyers on the unit) and `SF #` (count of SF applicants on the booking). These let reviewers spot multi-buyer units at a glance without opening the detail row. The dashboard (`output/dashboard.html`) shows a cross-project summary with MATCH / BUYER MISMATCH / Audit Tasks / A10 / A11 / A12 counts — click a project name to open its compare report directly.

## Audit-flag reference (A-codes)

The `audit_flags` column on each row carries zero or more pipe-separated A-codes. Filter by typing the code in the column header.

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| `A1` | SF has a title prefix DLD doesn't (cosmetic, normalised) | None — informational |
| `A3` | Name tokens order-swapped (cosmetic, normalised) | None |
| `A4` | Company prefix `M/S.` / `Messrs.` (cosmetic, normalised) | None |
| `A5` | Partial name overlap < 50% (possible transliteration) | Spot-check |
| `A6` | Partial name overlap ≥ 50% (likely middle name dropped) | Spot-check |
| `A7` | Villa / plot buyer+price fuzzy match | Confirm the buyer + price line up |
| `A8` | BUYER_MISMATCH that normalises to MATCH (false positive) | Review — likely benign |
| `A9` | Latest DLD tx is a bank — mortgage flow | Add a manual override with the real buyer |
| `A10` | Matched via co-applicant (not the SF primary applicant) | None — recorded for audit |
| `A11` | Area mismatch flagged (soft <threshold, OR hard but row already non-MATCH) | (a) <threshold — spot-check; raise with engineering if systematic. (b) Higher-precedence issue exists — fix that first. |
| `A12` | Multi-buyer ANY-MATCH — DLD unit has multiple buyers, SF booking name matches any one of them | None — informational; review if needed |

A1–A7 are treated as MATCH-eligible (per v0.9.11) — they upgrade BUYER_MISMATCH rows to MATCH. A8 / A9 still need review. A10 is informational only. A11 fires alongside the row's primary classification — does not change the status by itself. A12 is informational — records that the MATCH was achieved by ANY-MATCH logic across multiple DLD buyers.

## Troubleshooting

**"no such column: sf_project" / garbage in `sf_booking`**
→ Fixed in v0.9.2. Re-run `node index.js import-sf <xlsx>` to re-import with the correct parser.

**`better-sqlite3` complains about Node version mismatch**
→ Fixed in v0.7.x with a self-heal step in the bat launcher. If it recurs: `cd dl-processor && npm rebuild better-sqlite3`.

**`Bad uncompressed size: ...` stderr spam when importing SF xlsx**
→ Harmless; suppressed in `salesforce.js`.

**Compare produces `DLD_ONLY` for everything**
→ You probably imported DLD but didn't import SF. Check `[S] Status`. Import `sf-input/`.

**`AREA` stat card shows 0 for every project**
→ `manual_area` is empty. Fill area templates via `[Y]` (this is the expected initial state — area cross-check only triggers when staff data is present).

**`apply-areas` reports `applied 0; skipped N`**
→ The `area_sqm` column in your CSV is blank, non-numeric, or non-positive. Re-export with `area-template` if the file got out of shape; existing `manual_area` rows are pre-populated on every generate so re-runs don't lose data.

**HTML filters feel sticky**
→ Header filters + top search + stat cards compose (AND together). Hit the `Reset` button to clear everything.

## Changelog

### v0.9.17 (6 May 2026)

Phase A bundle — three small improvements landed on master after the master-data merge.

#### Audit-delta HTML buyer columns

`output/audit-delta/<name>.audit-delta.html` now shows **DLD #** and **SF #** buyer count columns per row, matching the layout used by `compare.html`. Auditors can spot multi-party units in the monthly tool-vs-auditor cross-check without expanding the detail view.

#### `[Z] Archive output` menu entry

New one-click archiving. Copies the current `output/` tree to `output/archive/<YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM>/`. Run before re-importing a corrected DLD file to keep the previous run's HTML reports and CSVs. Doesn't delete anything.

#### Dashboard test coverage

`test/dashboard.test.js` now exercises `buildProjectStat` and `writeDashboardHtml` end-to-end — synthesized compare results + master-data rows feed the renderer and the test asserts MATCH/BUYER/A10/A11/A12/Pending column counts plus filter+sort attributes.

Test count: 190 → **198**.

### v0.9.16 (4 May 2026)

Three quality-of-life improvements on the `feat/master-data-approval` branch.

#### Master-data + approval queue

A new `master_data` table (wide, one row per unit) is the single source of truth for staff-curated values: `buyer_name`, `purchase_price_aed`, `area_sqm`, `status`, `procedure_number`. Each field carries a `_source` provenance tag (`staff` / `dld_approved`) and a `_decided_at` timestamp.

- **Migration on first run** — existing `manual_override` rows (buyer overrides) and `manual_area` rows (SQM data) are automatically copied into `master_data` via `db.js` self-heal. The legacy tables are then frozen; all new reads and writes go to `master_data`.
- **`pending_change` table** — after every DLD import, differences between the incoming snapshot and `master_data` are queued here as `pending` rows (one per `(unit, field)`). This is the audit trail for DLD-proposed changes.
- **CSV round-trip approval workflow** — `[V] Review pending` writes `output/csv/pending-changes.csv`; staff set each row's `decision` to `approved` or `rejected` and save; `[B] Apply pending` reads the file back, promotes approved rows to `master_data`, and records the decision timestamps.

#### New CLI subcommands

- `node index.js review-pending` — writes `output/csv/pending-changes.csv`. Corresponds to menu `[V]`.
- `node index.js apply-pending` — applies decisions from `pending-changes.csv` to `master_data`. Corresponds to menu `[B]`.

#### Menu changes

- `[5]` renamed from "Manual Overrides" → **"Master Data (staff edits)"** — reflects the wider scope of the new table.
- **`[V] Review pending changes`** — new entry (was `[V] Verify / audit data`, now moved to `[A] Audit Report`).
- **`[B] Apply pending decisions`** — new entry.

#### Dashboard Pending column

`output/dashboard.html` gains a **Pending** column showing the count of unresolved `pending_change` rows per project. Lets staff see at a glance which projects have queued DLD-proposed changes waiting for approval.

#### Sobha-branded diff HTML

`output/diff/<name>.diff.html` now uses the same cream/bronze Sobha palette as `compare.html`, `dashboard.html`, and `audit-delta.html`. The previous dark-theme inline CSS has been replaced with `SOBHA_STYLE_CSS` from `src/html-styles.js`.

#### `[L] Last drop` menu entry

New one-click shortcut: scans `input/` and `sf-input/` for the newest `.xps`/`.csv`/`.xlsx` file, shows the filenames and dates, and runs the full pipeline after confirmation.

### v0.9.15 (4 May 2026)

Three feature branches merged into master, plus 8 polish fixes.

#### A12 — multi-buyer ANY-MATCH

Compare now handles DLD units where multiple buyers appear across different transactions. When the SF booking name matches any one of the DLD buyers (primary or resale), the row classifies as `MATCH + A12` instead of `BUYER_MISMATCH`. A12 is informational — no action required, but reviewers can filter by `A12` to audit any-match resolutions.

#### Dashboard (`output/dashboard.html`)

A cross-project summary HTML file is written after every `compare` run. Columns: Project (link to compare report), MATCH, BUYER MISMATCH, Audit Tasks, A10, A11, A12. Sortable by column header; filterable by project name. Skipped projects show a badge with the skip reason.

#### Output folder structure

All generated files now land in sub-folders:
- `output/compare/<name>.compare.html` — per-project HTML compare report
- `output/diff/<name>.diff.html` — per-project HTML diff report
- `output/csv/<name>.compare.csv`, `<name>.diff.csv`, `<name>.audit-tasks.csv`
- `output/dashboard.html` — cross-project summary

#### `diff` command flags

- `--since YYYY-MM-DD` — pick the diff baseline by date (snapshot imported before the given date) rather than always using the second-latest import.
- `--show-missing` — include units/transactions that disappeared between the two snapshots (hidden by default to reduce noise).

#### HTML buyer columns

`DLD #` and `SF #` columns on the compare HTML report show the count of DLD buyers and SF applicants per row, letting reviewers spot multi-party units without expanding the detail view.

#### Polish fixes (all on master)

- Consistent `[1/5]...[5/5]` step labels in the full-pipeline run.
- Per-project `try/catch` in `compare` and `diff` CLI — a corrupt project or locked file no longer kills the whole 30-project run.
- Friendly error message when SF `.xlsx` is open in Excel (`EBUSY`/`EPERM` → "close Excel and re-run").
- Dashboard sort uses `data-sort-val` on numeric cells — em-dash cells no longer sort as text ahead of numbers.
- CSV serialization: string arrays (`match_flags`) → pipe-joined; object arrays (`dld_buyers`, `sf_applicants`) → JSON-quoted.
- SF import deduplication by SHA-256: re-importing the same file is a no-op (returns the existing snapshot ID).
- Bulk transaction load in `compareProject`: one query per snapshot instead of one query per unit (~30,000 → ~30 queries on a full run).

### v0.9.14 (1 May 2026)

Two additive features ship in one branch — both extend the compare engine without changing existing match counts on rows where the new data is absent.

#### Multi-applicant name matching (A10)

Compare now walks all five SF applicant slots when matching DLD buyers — `applicant_name`, `applicant_2_name`, `applicant_3_name`, `applicant_4_name`, `applicant_details`. Co-applicant matches reclassify from `BUYER_MISMATCH` → `MATCH + A10`. Net effect: a measurable drop in BUYER_MISMATCH and a matching rise in MATCH on the next monthly run, with a new `A10` chip indicating the match was on a non-primary slot.

#### SQM area cross-check (A11 / AREA_MISMATCH)

- New durable table **`manual_area`** parallel to `manual_override`, keyed by `(project_id, unit_number_norm)`. Survives every SF re-import. Populated by staff via the new `[Y] Area template` workflow.
- Compare emits a new signal: below 5% threshold (configurable) → soft `A11` flag; at/above threshold → hard `AREA_MISMATCH` status (only escalates rows that would otherwise be MATCH).
- Per-project threshold via `area_threshold_pct` column on `project_mapping`, or `defaults.areaThresholdPct` / per-project `areaThresholdPct` in `config/project-mapping.json`. Default 5%.
- New stat card **AREA** between BUYER and DLD-only on every dashboard.
- New row fields: `manual_area_sqm`, `area_diff_sqm`, `area_diff_pct`. Three new HTML columns.

#### Template / apply CLI

- `node index.js area-template [project|all]` → emits `output/area-template-<slug>.csv`. One row per DLD unit, including DLD buyer (via `pickLatestPurchase` so mortgage flips don't show banks), expected SF unit (mapping-aware — honours `unitTransforms` / `buildingTransforms`), and any existing `manual_area` value pre-populated.
- `node index.js apply-areas <csv>` → upserts each row whose `area_sqm` is a positive number into `manual_area`. Unit numbers normalised through the same `normalizeUnitNumber` the parser uses, so keys always match `dld_unit.unit_number_norm`. Each apply writes one entry to `logs/audit.jsonl`.
- New menu entry `[Y] Area template` with sub-options to generate / apply.

#### CLI summary + audit report

- `node index.js compare` summary line now includes `AREA:N` between BUYER and DLD-only.
- `node index.js audit` (`[V]`) gains an "Area cross-check coverage" section — per project, how many DLD units have a `manual_area` row populated.

#### Schema migrations

- New `manual_area` table.
- New `project_mapping.area_threshold_pct` column.
- Both auto-migrate on next launch via the existing self-heal pattern in `src/db.js`. Existing DBs inherit zero-area-data state; output is identical to v0.9.13 until templates are filled.

#### Test coverage

29 new tests across 5 new test files (`test/area-signal.test.js`, `test/area-classification.test.js`, `test/area-template.test.js`, `test/area-threshold-resolve.test.js`, `test/compare-multi-applicant.test.js`) plus 2 added to the schema-migration suite. Total 118 tests, all green.

#### Deferred (planned for a future HTML overhaul)

- `?` popovers on A10 / A11 chips — current HTML has no popover infrastructure.
- Default-hidden area columns (`Manual SQM`, `Area Δ sqm`) — current HTML has no column-picker UI.
- Status legend section on the dashboard — current HTML has no legend block.
